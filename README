  The script takes a symbol for a specific financial asset (e.g. a stock, currency, commodity) as inputs, and retrieves historical financial data for that asset from “eodhistoricaldata” API. The retrieved data is then passed through a function which processes the data in some way (e.g. adding technical indicators, normalizing values). The processed data is then split into training and testing sets and used to train a machine learning model to make predictions about the future values of the asset. The model is then evaluated using the testing data.

	This code could be useful for anyone interested in using machine learning techniques to make predictions about financial assets. My current goals for this project are to improve the accuracy of predictions on historical data so I could then apply the model to trade stocks in realtime using a brokerage API.
